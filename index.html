            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Under Nicolae Ceaușescu's leadership, Romania experienced severe economic hardships. In 1981, the regime initiated an austerity program aimed at repaying the national debt, leading to widespread shortages of basic goods, rationing, and a significant decline in living standards. The secret police, known as the Securitate, maintained strict control over the populace, suppressing dissent and fostering an atmosphere of fear. Ceaușescu's cult of personality further isolated the leadership from the realities faced by ordinary Romanians.</p>

            <h2>Catalyst in Timișoara</h2>
            <p>The revolution ignited in Timișoara on December 16, 1989, following the government's attempt to evict Hungarian Reformed Church pastor László Tőkés, a vocal critic of the regime. Parishioners and local residents formed a human chain around Tőkés's residence in protest. This act of defiance rapidly escalated into mass demonstrations against Ceaușescu's policies. The government's decision to use military force against the protesters resulted in numerous casualties, further fueling public outrage and sparking nationwide protests.</p>

            <h2>Ceaușescu's Downfall</h2>
            <p>In a bid to assert control, Ceaușescu organized a mass rally in Bucharest on December 21, intending to demonstrate popular support. However, the crowd openly jeered and booed him—a clear indication of the regime's waning influence. The following day, after the death of Defense Minister Vasile Milea under suspicious circumstances, the military withdrew its support for Ceaușescu. Facing overwhelming opposition, Ceaușescu and his wife, Elena, attempted to flee but were captured. They were swiftly tried and executed on December 25, 1989.</p>

            <h2>Aftermath and Interpretations</h2>
            <p>The revolution resulted in significant casualties, with over a thousand people killed and several thousand injured. In the immediate aftermath, the National Salvation Front (FSN), composed largely of former communist officials, assumed power, leading to debates about the nature of the revolution. Some historians and analysts argue that the events constituted a genuine popular uprising against an oppressive regime. Others suggest that elements within the Communist Party orchestrated a coup to depose Ceaușescu while preserving their power, indicating a more controlled transition.</p>
